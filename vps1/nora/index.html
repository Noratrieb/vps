        <p>hey, I'm nora! i think. maybe. who knows, really</p>
        <p>this website is work in progress. just like me fr.</p>
        <p>all of this is very complicated.</p>
        <p>it's very empty for now.</p>
        <p>i hope it will be fuller in the future. worth visiting. for now, it just exists.</p>
        <p>i expect to visit it quite often.</p>
        <p>not that i expect anyone to want to do that, but this site is not exactly intended for sharing.</p>
        <p>..for now. in the future it will be. maybe.</p>
